# Loot
Find joy in the little things :)

## Our Vision:
A reimagined retail experience that combines the joy of online shopping with fun game-like swiping gestures, with no monetary commitment for the user, and increased exposure for the retailer

## Summary:
Loot is a new way to discover products that are tailored to your taste. Who knows, maybe you'll discover some hidden treasure!

This project is a platform, where users swipe to purchase and find new items. Using the swipe and purchasing history of a user, our app is able to recommend to them and hide items from them as well.

### Current Features:
- Log-in page (no username/password verification implemented yet)
- Category selection for filtering (filtering aspect not applied yet)
- Add items to a wishlist using a right swipe + ability to edit the wishlist
- Add items to the shopping cart using an upward swipe
- Get rid of items using a left swipe
- Cart checkout from app + Receive order in Moltin dashboard

### ML.py
Our team developed a "scoring system" for one category of goods, so we could display a proof of concept to show what our future ML algorithm would essentially do.
